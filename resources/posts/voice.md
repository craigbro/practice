I sat down to take my next step, to write the next post, and soon had
100 lines of text in [someone else's
voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_M%C3%A9sz%C3%A1ros_%28professor%29).

It was [someone I admire](http://leobabauta.com/bio.html) and whose
[writings](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/) have been a
part of my thoughts for over a decade.  I was soon filled with a sense
of dread.  How would I live up to such a voice?  Was that really the
voice I needed now?

The dread turned into frustration, then a sense of being overwhelmed
by the scope of what I wanted to write about.  In my mind, the phrase:

> I want to create a historically maintainable, hegemonic alternative
> to the social-metabolic order of capitalism.

is sensible, precise, and inspiring.  I doubt it rings like that in
other ears though.  I thought I would explain all the terms, unpack
it.  Soon I was planning out a grand essay, or a book.  I would have
to be rigorous and extensive in my presentation of my thought.  I
would have to defend it against critics who had no interest in
improving it, only destroying or discrediting it.

So I took a break and had a beer.

I get into conversations at bars frequently.  I am careful, I start
slowly, let questions indicate further interest, and I limit my scope
and detail to appropriate levels.

This could be a useful voice, but I have some issues with it, and as a
voice for writing it suffers from lag in feedback.  Its vocabulary
adjusted, its pace tuned, as I learn more about the audience.  That
voice is not a very precise guide here, where an audience is an
abstraction for now.

There is another problem, though.  I am practicing my writing in order
to develop the ideas I have, and to share them with others so they can
grow.  A conversational voice that is geared towards being accesible
and simple in it's argumentation, is not a good tool for exploring the
details of an idea, to explore how to turn the idea into a tool for
transforming onseself and the world.  It is tethered by wanting to be
where the audience is at, but also where my head and hopes of the
future are at.
