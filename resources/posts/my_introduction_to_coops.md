{:date "2011/12/13" :author "Craig Brozefsky" :title "My Introduction to Worker Cooperatives"}

Yesterday I met with two neighbors, Tom and Emily, who specialize in
developing cooperatives, It was a continuation of a conversation we
started in a bar, of course.  They listened patiently as I tried to
outline my rather abstract notion of what kind of coop I wanted to
build or work for.  

By the end of brunch they had given me several places to start my
investigation, some guidance on the legal structures available, and
pointers to existing worker coops that worked with technology or had
similar ideas.  They also helped me plan the next steps, namely
developing my ideas some more, and in more concrete terms, and finding
other people.

I spent the day following the breadcrumbs they provides, and here are
the results:

# Definitions of Worker Cooperatives

Tom suggested I contact the [Democracy At Work
Network](http://dawn.coop), and gave me an idea of what I should have
done before I do so.

They define member worker cooperatives by the [Oslo
Declaration](http://usworker.coop/public/documents/Oslo_Declaration.pdf)
which was written by the [CICOPA](http://www.cicopa.coop/).  The Oslo
Declaration refers to the [Statement on the Co-operative
Identity](http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html) as defined by the
[International Cooperative Alliance](http://www.ica.coop).

# A Model for Thinking about Coop Culture

Within the DAWN reading room, I came across a paper, [Does Cooperation
Equal
Utopia](http://www.usworker.coop/system/files/Does_Cooperation_Equal_Utopia%20%28P%29_0.pdf).
It is a survey of three worker coops, and includes a quick reading
introduction to the authors analytic model, which is based on Edgar
Shein's work on organization culture.

In the Edgar Schein's model of organizations, the *Basic Assumptions*
are pre-conscious, invisible, or taken for granted, but are also the
foundation for the value system and cultural justifications of the
work.  Presented as examples of such assumptions are:

* relationships to the environment
* nature of reality and truth
* nature of human activity
* nature of human nature
* nature of human relationships

While these are the foundation of the organizational culture, they are
also enacted and created, or re-enforced over time.  They are not
static, tho they may be difficult to change.

This makes me ask a few questions:

* The pre-conscious or invisible nature of them is not permanent.  We
  can investigate them ourselves, learn about the history of them, how
  we inherited them or formed them, how they change over time.

* What do we know about how these assumption percolate up into more
  visible value systems?

* What do we know about how actions and material conditions of the
  culture press back down on the basic assumptions.

I suppose these are rather basic questions within the field of
organizational culture, but I'm not familiar with the literature.  The
model also reminds me of the kind of analysis Istvan Meszaros has done
in **Social Structure and Forms of Consciousness**.
