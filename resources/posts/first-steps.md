I am building a simple blog app using
[Clojure](http://www.clojure.org) and [Noir](http://www.webnoir.org).
It runs from a git repo. Pages and posts are files I can edit in
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs).  It runs on
[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), who graciously provides free hosting
for small projects like this.

The entire site, content included, is available at:

[https://www.github.com/craigbro/practice](https://www.github.com/craigbro/practice)

I'm doing this because I want a space to practice my sharing, my
writing.  Part of that is developing a voice that can carry more than
a tweet or an email conversation.  I wrote my own blog software
because it was the only way for me to not be annoyed by ill-fitting
tools.

This is my initial post, these are my first steps.
