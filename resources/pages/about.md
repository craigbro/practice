## About This Practice

I am practicing the act of sharing, with the hope of getting better at
it.  For me, the desire to share is not new, but making it a core
priority is.

I have worked as a software developer for years, the last couple years
being in a sector of the industry that really enjoys its secrets.  I
did share a few bits of software, but I have never been good at it.

I have shared my thoughts in writing on mailing lists, and in other
shortened forms, but have seldom laid out the more complicated
thoughts, or dove deeply into the simple ones.

### The Software

The entire site, content included, is available at:

[https://www.github.com/craigbro/practice](https://www.github.com/craigbro/practice)

It's written in [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org), and uses the
[Noir](www.webnoir.org) web framework.  All posts and pages are files,
and there is no database.  The CSS theme was given to the world by
[Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/theme).
