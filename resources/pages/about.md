## About This Practice


This is a space for me to practice the act of sharing, with the hope
of getting better at it.  For me, the desire to share is not new, but
making it a core priority is.

I have worked as a software developer for years, the last couple years
being in a sector of the industry that really enjoys its secrets.  I
did share a few bits of software, but I have never been good at it.

For many years I have shared my thoughts in writing on mailing lists,
and in other shortened forms, but have seldom laid out the more
complicated thoughts, or dove deeply into the simple ones.
