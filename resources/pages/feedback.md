I can be emailed at:

Or you can write on your own blog, and let me know so I can read it.

I discovered Usenet around 1993, and met some of my best friends
there.  I have been on some mailing lists for over a decade, and
learned so much about the world in weird places like Leri-L and
Cypherpunks.  My email client is [Gnus](http://www.gnus.org).

All this is to say, I hate web forums, and comment forms.
